Single sheet model:
{
	sheet: string,
	columns: []
}
Single column:
	{ name, column, type?, referenceSheet?, referenceColumn, options?, min?, max?, validateCell? }

A full google sheets document can be described as an array of 'sheet' objects.

Column docs:
	'min' and 'max' are used as clamp values when type = 'number' and as character limits when type = 'string'.
	'options' should be an array of accepted values, this will only be used if type == 'options'.
	'referenceSheet' and 'referenceColumn' are used together to limit the allowed inputs of a column to the values in another column.
		Only works if type == 'reference'.
	validateCell should be a function taking the cell contents and returning a boolean.
		This function is called on every cell that is gotten via this column.
	Values with '?' are optional or only required in case of particular types.

Types:
	'string': treated as a regular string.
	'options': requires options to be defined. Only accepts values also present in options.
	(note: i'm not yet sure about the date handling)
	'date-dmy': Treated as a day-month-year date.
	'date-ymd': Treated as a year-month-day date.
	'date-mdy': Treated as a month-day-year date.
