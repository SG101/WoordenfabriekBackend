Single sheet model:
{
	sheet: string,
	columns: [
		{name, column, type?, options?, min?, max?, validateCell?}
	]
}
Single column:
	{name, column, type?, options?, min?, max?, validateCell?}

A full google sheets document can be described as an array of 'sheet' objects.

Column docs:
	min and max are used as clamp values when type = 'number' and as character limits when type = 'string'.
	options should be an array of accepted values, this will only be used if type == 'options'.
	validateCell should be a function taking the cell contents and returning a boolean,
		this function is called on every cell that is gotten via this column.
	Values with '?' are optional or only required in case of particular types.
Types:
	'string': treated as a regular string.
	'options': requires options to be defined. Only accepts values also present in options.
	(note: i'm not yet sure about the date handling)
	'date-dmy': Treated as a day-month-year date.
	'date-ymd': Treated as a year-month-day date.
	'date-mdy': Treated as a month-day-year date.
