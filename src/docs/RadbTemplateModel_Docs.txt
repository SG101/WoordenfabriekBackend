Single sheet model:
{
	sheet: string,
	columns: []
}
Single column:
	{ name, column, type?, referenceSheet?, referenceColumn?, options?, min?, max?, validateCell? }

A full google sheets document can be described as an array of 'sheet' objects.

Column docs:
	'min' and 'max' are used as clamp values when type = 'number' and as character limits when type = 'string'.
	'options' should be an array of accepted values, this will only be used if type == 'options'.
	'referenceSheet' and 'referenceColumn' are used together to limit the allowed inputs of a column to the values in another column.
		Only works if type == 'reference'.
	'validateCell' should be a function taking the cell contents and returning a boolean.
		This function is called on every cell that is gotten via this column.
	'list' columns are interpreted as a comma-separated list.
		These will  
	Values with '?' are optional or only required in case of particular types.

Types:
	'string': treated as a regular string.
		'min' and 'max' are used to define the minimum and maximum number of characters in the cell.
	'options': requires 'options' attribute to be defined.
		the 'options' attribute is a list of possible values.
	'reference': only accepts values present in a given column of a given sheet.
		requires 'referenceColumn' and 'referenceSheet' to be defined.
		referenceSheet needs to be the name of another sheet in the model.
		referenceColumn needs to be either the letter identifier or the model name of a column in said sheet.
	'list': a comma-separated list of strings.
		'min' and 'max' are used to clamp the amount of allowed options per cell.
	'number': treated as a javascript number.
		'min' and 'max' are used to clamp the lowest possible and highest possible values.
